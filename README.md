Mechanica
=========

Mechanica is the simplified shell for web developers. 

I plan to create a Textmate bundle that would help me and (hope so) other developers to spend less time switching between contexts and search for the very terminal with current project opened.

This is how it looks now:

It's an extremely early stage of development, so please, be patient =)

Hugely inspired by [Cloud9 IDE](https://github.com/ajaxorg/cloud9/), [Terminal](http://danrabbit.deviantart.com/art/Terminal-211598932?q=boost%3Apopular%20terminal&qo=10) by *DanRabbit, [ZSH theme](http://dribbble.com/shots/499170-iTerm2-colors-and-ZSH-theme) by Juan G. Hurtado and thrust of overall simplicity.
